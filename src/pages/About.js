          <p>Hi, I'm Maria, an engineer by profession and a programmer by passion. <br />
            Aspiring Front-End Developer diving into web technologies and
            programming languages.
            In the near future I would like to develop in writing mobile applications as
well. <br /> I program in front-end technologies, I like React.js especially. <br />
            I believe that everyday practice is the key to self-development, and programming possibilities are endless, which is why I like it so much.<br />
            I graduated from University of Economics in Pozna≈Ñ with a Master's - Engineer degree in the field of Commodity Science but have been a Product Manager for last few years in the field of electromagnetic components. <br />
            I find technical knowledge pleasant and accessible.
Learning new programming languages and tools became an addicting and
satisfying process for me.
          </p>
